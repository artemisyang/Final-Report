# Final Report

**Final Report** (*35%*): The final project report is the distillation of your group's efforts over the course of the Quarter. **Only one report** should be submitted by your group, with each person's name on the report. It should be around 12-15 pages double spaced, excluding references (and you can have an Appendix of any length you like). Note that the report should include in-line code and output, allowing for reproducibility. The final report should contain some combination (if not all) of the following sections, which we will go over throughout the Quarter in detail:
	
* Title Page and Contribution Statement (listing all group members and their roles in the project; note that by typing your name on the project, you agree that you contributed *equally* to the project)
* Introduction & (light) Literature Review
* Empirical Strategy (methods, data, preprocessing, etc.)
* Analysis & Results
* Discussion
* Conclusion
